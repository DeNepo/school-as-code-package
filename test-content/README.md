## Materials

### [Merge A Matic](https://github.com/lpmi-13/merge-a-matic)

One of the difficult parts of collaboration is dealing with merge conflicts.
Never fear, though! In this repository, we'll walk through how to resolve one
such conflict.

### [Reflog Power](https://github.com/lpmi-13/reflog-power)

- [open in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lpmi-13/reflog-power) |

  | [milestone](https://github.com///milestone/0)

The basic idea is to practice accidentally deleting one of our local branches
(which I've done a few times), and then finding it again in the reflog. Scary,
right! I used to think so, but don't worry...the reflog can help us.

### [Rebasic](https://github.com/lpmi-13/rebasic)

- [open in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lpmi-13/rebasic) |

  | [milestone](https://github.com///milestone/0)

Rebasing is scary for people. We need to practice it to feel less scared.
Practicing with immediate actionable feedback could help this process.

### [Tree Slayer](https://github.com/lpmi-13/tree-slayer)

Have you ever wondered about the deep git magicks...?

Have you ever heard about git's ability to delete a file across the entire git
history in a recursive rebase-like fashion...?

Have you ever been reading the ancient scrolls late at night, and come across
the git filter-branch command...?
